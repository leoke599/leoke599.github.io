                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Mission Overview</h3>
                <p>The Mars Transit Habitat is a theoretical space habitat that is supposed to last 8-9 months in space meant to bring humans to Mars.</p>
                
                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6">Problem Statement</h3>
                <p>A manned mission to Mars will require a habitat that can support the crew for the duration of the mission, which is expected to last <strong>8-9 months</strong>. Unlike Earth-based missions or even International Space Station operations, there are currently no plans to resupply the Mars habitat during the mission duration.</p>
                
                <p>This means the crew must bring all consumables with them, including the entire food supply for the long journey and surface operations. The food storage system faces unique challenges:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-3 mb-3 ml-4">
                    <li><strong>Extended Duration:</strong> Food must remain safe and nutritious for over 8-9 months</li>
                    <li><strong>Limited Power:</strong> Habitat power systems are constrained and must be conserved</li>
                    <li><strong>Microgravity Operation:</strong> Traditional refrigeration systems don't work in zero gravity</li>
                    <li><strong>Space Environment:</strong> Extreme temperature variations and vacuum conditions</li>
                    <li><strong>No Maintenance:</strong> System must operate reliably without external repair capabilities</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6">Our Solution: The Space Freezer</h3>
                <p>Our goal is to design and develop an innovative freezer/refrigeration system specifically engineered for the Mars habitat environment. This system must:</p>
                
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-3 mb-3 ml-4">
                    <li><strong>Maximize Energy Efficiency:</strong> Utilize space conditions (extreme cold, vacuum) to assist cooling processes</li>
                    <li><strong>Ensure Food Safety:</strong> Maintain proper temperatures for thermostabilized and frozen foods</li>
                    <li><strong>Operate in Microgravity:</strong> Function without relying on gravity-based cooling circulation</li>
                    <li><strong>Maintain Reliability:</strong> Provide consistent performance throughout the entire mission duration</li>
                    <li><strong>Optimize Space Usage:</strong> Efficiently store maximum food quantity in minimal habitat space</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6">Innovation Approach</h3>
                <p>Our design leverages the unique conditions of space to create a more efficient cooling system than traditional Earth-based refrigeration. By utilizing the vacuum of space and extreme temperature differentials, we can reduce power consumption while maintaining optimal food preservation temperatures.</p>
