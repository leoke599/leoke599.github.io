                <p>Problem Statement:
                <br>A manned mission to Mars will require a habitat that can support the crew for the duration of the mission, which is expected to last 1100-1200 days. There are (currently) no plans to resupply the Mars habitat,  so the crew will need to bring all of their food with them. The food will need to be stored in a way that preserves its nutritional value and prevents spoilage. They plan on using some thermostabilized foods, but these foods will still need to be stored in a freezer/fridge to ensure they remain safe to eat.
                <br><br>Goal:
                <br>The goal of the space freezer is to create a freezer/fridge to preserve the food. The food storage needs to be as energy efficient as possible, as the habitat will have limited power available, so the freezer/fridge needs to use space conditions to help with the cooling process. The freezer/fridge also needs to be able to operate in a microgravity environment, as the habitat will be in space.

                <p><br>Zach Flower - Computer Science and Cybersecurity Instructor<br><br>Zachary brings more than 15 years of experience in computer science and cybersecurity to Warren Tech. Before teaching, he worked as the Director of Engineering at Inspirato and held roles as an engineering manager and software engineer at organizations including Automox, Name.com, and the NSA. He earned a BS in Computer Science from CU Boulder and is also a freelance writer whose work has been published in TechTarget, 2600 Magazine, and Hello World magazine.
                <br><br>He believes software development is a trade that can completely change the trajectory of someone’s life without requiring expensive degrees—just curiosity and a willingness to learn. Zachary enjoys guiding students on that journey and watching them grow into confident developers. In his free time, he describes himself as an “avid indoorsman,” often found reading or (not surprisingly) coding.</p>
                
                <p><br>Nathan Olsen - Engineering Design & Build Instructor<br><br> Nate started teaching at Warren Tech in 2009 and brings 22 years of experience in the industry. His background includes roles as a drafter for a pharmaceutical company, designing packaging, and working as a contracted drafter for outside projects. He has also been working with NASA for 11 years, helping students design and prototype hardware for use in training and flight.
                <br><br>Outside of teaching, Nate enjoys fishing, golfing, camping, and going on road trips. He holds a Bachelor of Science in Industrial Technology in Education and a Master’s in Informational Technology in Education. His favorite aspect of working in Engineering: Design and Build is the daily variety and new challenges that come with the role.</p>
