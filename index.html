                <p>Zach Flower<br><br>Zachary brings more than 15 years of experience in computer science and cybersecurity to Warren Tech. Before teaching, he worked as the Director of Engineering at Inspirato and held roles as an engineering manager and software engineer at organizations including Automox, Name.com, and the NSA. He earned a BS in Computer Science from CU Boulder and is also a freelance writer whose work has been published in TechTarget, 2600 Magazine, and Hello World magazine.
                <br><br>He believes software development is a trade that can completely change the trajectory of someone’s life without requiring expensive degrees—just curiosity and a willingness to learn. Zachary enjoys guiding students on that journey and watching them grow into confident developers. In his free time, he describes himself as an “avid indoorsman,” often found reading or (not surprisingly) coding.</p>

                <p>Mr. Olsen<br><br> Nate started teaching at Warren Tech in 2009 and brings 22 years of experience in the industry. His background includes roles as a drafter for a pharmaceutical company, designing packaging, and working as a contracted drafter for outside projects. He has also been working with NASA for 11 years, helping students design and prototype hardware for use in training and flight.
                <br><br>Outside of teaching, Nate enjoys fishing, golfing, camping, and going on road trips. He holds a Bachelor of Science in Industrial Technology in Education and a Master’s in Informational Technology in Education. His favorite aspect of working in Engineering: Design and Build is the daily variety and new challenges that come with the role.</p>
